# MyTicket (clean architecture project)
This is the source code for my posts on [PureSourceCode](https://www.puresourcecode.com) where I want to explain how to explain how to [architecting ASP.NET Core applications](https://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/net-core/architecting-asp-net-core-applications/) for enterprise projects based on clean architecture principles. In particular, I want to write this as an extension of how to [create a digital transformation in your company](https://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/digital-transformation-scenario-azure-visual-studio-git/). First, for architecting ASP.NET Core Applications we have to learn:

*   Clean architecture with ASP.NET Core
*   Best practices
*   Common packages
*   Testable and maintainable

The source code of this post is on [GitHub](https://github.com/erossini/MyTicket). Because one single post is too long, I have created the following posts:

*   [Architecting ASP.NET Core applications](https://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/net-core/architecting-asp-net-core-applications/)
*   [Setting up the application core](https://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/net-core/setting-up-the-application-asp-net-core/)
*   Creating the infrastructure project
*   Adding an API using ASP.NET Core
*   Testing the application code
*   Adding a UI
*   Improving on the application's behaviour
